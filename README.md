# Saving_Reading_Grouping_Data_in_HDF5
HDF format is great for storing large multivariant datasets

Here are a few examples to perform the following changes to HDF5 files; 
A. Set Working Directory
B. Create Random DataFrame
C. Read and Print HDF5 files
D. Mandatory to close the file "f.close()"
E. Read Datasets and Produce Groups and SubGroups inside hdf file
F. Compress HDF5 Files as if compression will matter... :)
G. Set and Read Attributes
Please let me know if some of the code helps.
